These are just a bunch of small programs created when I was learning Ruby.

** Computer **
A program with classes and objects. It involved creating 'users' with 'passwords'.


** Bank Account **
A program with bank accounts, and the options to withdraw, deposit, and display the balance.

** Movies **
A program utilizing a loop, where there is a movie directory with ratings and you have the option to add a movie, update a rating, delete a rating, and display the ratings.
